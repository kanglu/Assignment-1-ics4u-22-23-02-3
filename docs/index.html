<p>I've been working on customizing my Neovim setup for quite sometime now,
and I have been itching for a project that I can hone in my keyboard skills
and muscle memory of this text editor. One evening, my son and I were
discussing merge sort and how the algorithm can be augmented without changing
the original data elements. He told me it was part of his new
<a href="../lesson/instructions.pdf">assignment</a>.</p>
<p>Long story short, I decided this assignment would be a good trial for my new
Neovim setup. Not going to lie. I think I was more excited than my son on
this assignment.</p>
<p>I created my merge sort, debugging it using Neovim, and its corresponding
<code>nivm-dap-vscode-js</code> DAP adapter plugin, and the <code>vscode-js-debug</code>. The
experience was okay and on par with Visual Studio Code on the same HW
platform. However, I liked the fact that I was able to debug it even
through <code>ssh</code>.</p>
<p>As the old saying goes, no software project is ever completed, we just know
when to stop. I decided to end my exploration of Neovim here, culminated in
this little handy <a href="../">web site</a> that can explore the IMDB data quite
nicely. I especially liked my visual interpretation of the Six Degrees of
Kevin Bacon. I did not follow the instructions verbatim, rather applied the
spirit of the original requirements and applied my own interpretation of the
look and feel of the final rendition.</p>
<p>I skipped the <strong>Hit List</strong> concept, as I thought without a proper persistent backend,
the user could have simply used the browser bookmarks to the end IMDB links
which are way more resourceful than anything I could cook up in the
short term.</p>
<p>I put some source code documentation on my <strong>Merge Sort</strong> and <strong>Searching</strong>
algorithms. I also commented on my technique of the <strong>Actor Connection</strong>
algorithm. All of which were inlined with JSDOC and can be accessed with
the menu on the right of this page.</p>
<p>Here is a quick demo of its navigation and capabilities:</p>
